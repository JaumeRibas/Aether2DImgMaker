#This is the source file. The other files are translations of this one.

#version 1.0

#The following versioning system is used: MAJOR.MINOR

#    MAJOR version is incremented when changes are made that MUST be reflected in the translation files. For example: 
#		- One or more keys are added.
#		- The information provided by one or more messages is changed.
#		- Format specifiers are added, removed or changed in one or more message formats (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Formatter.html).
#		- A breaking error in a message format is fixed.

#    MINOR version is incremented when any other change is made. The translation files can still be used without changes, but it's best to review them to reflect the changes in them. Some examples of these changes are:
#		- One or more keys are removed.
#		- One or more messages are changed without changing the information they provide (e.g., rephrased for clarity).
#		- Unambiguous writing errors are fixed.

#param descriptions
initial-config-description = (This is the main parameter so its name can be omitted)\nThe initial configuration for the model.\nThe currently available configurations are:\n\n  single-source_{value} or just {value}: for a single source initial configuration of {value} (e.g., 'single-source_-1000' or '-1000').\n\n  random-region_{side}_{min}_{max}: for an initial configuration consisting of an hypercubic region of side {side} filled with random values ranging form {min} to {max} (e.g., 'random-region_250_-45_60').\nNote that outside this region the value will be zero.\n\nExample: java -jar AetherImgMaker.jar random-region_250_-45_60
asymmetric-description = Generate images only of an asymmetric section of a symmetric model.\n\nExample: java -jar AetherImgMaker.jar 1000 -asymmetric
backup-every-description = The preferred number of millisencods between automatic backups. No backups are made by default.
colormap-description = The colormap to use for the images.\nThe currently available colormaps are: Grayscale and Hue.
coordinate-filters-description = A semicolon separated list of coordinate filters to restrict the image generation to a subregion of the grid. The coordinates are denoted by an 'x' followed by a numeric index between one and the grid's dimension, both included, e.g., x1, x2 and x3.\nThe currently available filters are:\n\n  {coordinate}{=|>|<}{integer}: to target the region where a coordinate is either equal to or greater or less than a certain value, e.g., x2=-5, x1>0, x3<-2\n\n  {coordinate}={+|-}{coordinate}{+|-}{integer}: to target the region where a coordinate is equal to another coordinate, or its opposite, plus/minus a value (optional), e.g., x1=x3, x2=-x4+6\n\nNote that the whole set of filters might need to be surrounded with double quotes in case a '<' or '>' character is used. This is to prevent the shell from interpreting these characters.\n\nExample: java -jar AetherImgMaker.jar -100000 -grid 5d -coordinate-filters "x1=0;x2=1;x3=x4;x4>-1;x4<1921;x5>-1;x5<1081"
first-step-description = The app skips ahead to this step without generating images. If the first step provided is greater than the model's last step, the app will stop a the last step plus one.
grid-description = The type of grid to use.\nCurrently, the only available types are:\n\n  {dimension}d: an infinite flat grid of dimension {dimension} (e.g., 3d).\n\n  {dimension}d_{side}: a finite flat grid shaped as a hypercube of dimension {dimension} and side {side} (e.g., 2d_101).
help-description = Print the list of parameters.
image-generation-mode-description = Parameter to affect the image generation.\nThe currently available modes are:\n\n  normal\n\n  split-coordinate-parity: generate two sets of images, one of the even coordinates of the grid and another of the odd ones.\n\n  even-coordinates-only: generate images only of the even coordinates of the grid.\n\n  odd-coordinates-only: generate images only of the odd coordinates of the grid.\n\n  toppling-alternation-compliance (only available for the Aether model with single source initial configuration): color positions based on whether they keep the original toppling alternation phase between von Neumann neighbors.
image-name-description = The name of the generated images.\nThe step index will be appended to this string.\nBy default, the model name followed by an underscore is used.
memory-safe-description = Use temporary files, within the -path folder, to store the grid so as to avoid running out of memory. In exchange, processing speed and storage space are sacrificed.
minimum-image-size-description = The minimum size of the generated images in pixels, with the format {width}x{height} (e.g., 1920x1080).\nThe images can be bigger if the grid region is too big to fit using 1:1 pixel to position scale. The aspect ratio is always mantained. If the scaled grid region is smaller than the image, it is aligned to the bottom left corner and the background colored in black.

model-description = The model to generate images from.\nThe currently available models are:\n\n  Aether: https://github.com/JaumeRibas/Aether2DImgMaker/wiki/Aether-Cellular-Automaton-Definition\n\n  Spread_Integer_Value, SIV: https://github.com/JaumeRibas/Aether2DImgMaker/wiki/SIV-Cellular-Automaton-Definition\n\n  Abelian_sandpile: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model
no-folders-description = Do not create a subfolder structure at the -path aside from numbered folders.
path-description = The path of the parent folder where the images are created. By default, a subfolder structure is created at this location for organizational purposes. This can be prevented using the -no-folders parameter.
restore-description = The path of a backup to restore.
scan1-start-description = The scan1 will start at this coordinate. Only applies to model sections with dimension three (see the -grid and -coordinate-filters parameters).
scan2-start-description = The scan2 will start at this coordinate. Only applies to model sections with dimension three (see the -grid and -coordinate-filters parameters).
scan3-start-description = The scan3 will start at this coordinate. Only applies to model sections with dimension three (see the -grid and -coordinate-filters parameters).
step-leap-description = The app will generate images at the steps multiple of this number. If this number is greater than one, the app will also generate an image at the last step plus one of the model.
version-description = Print the version of the app.
