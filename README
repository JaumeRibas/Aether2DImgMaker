Aether2DImgMaker
----------------

Console app to generate images from the Aether automaton in two dimensions with an initial configuration of a single non-cero value in an empty grid. 
Generates an image for each step of the automaton with a hue color map. 
The images show only a non-symmetric 'slice' of the grid.

Parameters:

1st) Initial value for the automaton (mandatory)

2nd) Image folder path (optional)
	default: "./"
	The following sub-folder structure will be created at this location: 
	'/Aether2D/<initial value>/img/<Color map>/slice/<numbered folder>'
	Each numbered folder will contain up to 10,000 images. 
	
3rd) Initial step (optional)
	The app will skip ahead to this step without generating images.
