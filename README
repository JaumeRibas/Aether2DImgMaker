Aether2DImgMaker
----------------

Console apps to generate images from the Aether and SIV CAs in various dimensions and initial configurations. 


Aether2DImgMaker.java

	Generate images from the Aether CA in two dimensions with an initial configuration of a single non-cero value in an empty grid. 
	Generates an image for each step of the CA with a hue color map. 
	The images show only an asymmetric section of the grid.

	Parameters:

	1st) Initial value for the CA (mandatory)

	2nd) Image folder path (optional)
		default: "./"
		The following sub-folder structure will be created at this location: 
		'/Aether2D/<initial value>/asymmetric_section/img/<Color map>/<numbered folder>'
		Each numbered folder will contain up to 10,000 images. 
		
	3rd) Initial step (optional)
		The app will skip ahead to this step without generating images.
